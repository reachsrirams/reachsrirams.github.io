      <description>&lt;p&gt;First of all a very happy new year to all the readers. The fact that this blog comes more than a month into 2017 should give you hints on what sort of goals I have planned for 2017 first half. I will start with an assessment of the second half of 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I have been doing for last few years, it is time to assess how well I have done on my blogging and learning goals. I will also share my goals for the second half of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here I am once again, with fresh blogging and learning goals for the first half of 2015. This time I am able to share my goals earlier than usual. In the past, I was delayed by almost 2 months. This is clearly a good start for me and I hope that the rest of the year, I am able to stick to a better cadence for my blogging.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the year, I had set myself &lt;a href=&#34;http://reachsrirams.github.io/blogs/blogs/2013/01/01/goals-for-2013/&#34;&gt;few goals&lt;/a&gt; related to my blogging and learning activities. This belated mid-year review of those goals already gives an indication of how I have performed against the goals I set for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Goals for 2013</title>
      <link>http://reachsrirams.github.io/blogs/2013/01/01/goals-for-2013/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before I share my goals for the first half of 2013, here is an assessment of my 2012 goals. Around mid 2012, I had set out with some goals to learn a JavaScript, CSS and HTML5 as part of UTM URL Generator project. You can check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.innervoice.in/blogs/2012/06/29/how-i-am-learning-javascript-and-css/&#34;&gt;those goals here&lt;/a&gt;. Around November I reworked some of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.innervoice.in/blogs/2012/11/16/changes-to-my-url-generator-project-milestones/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;milestones of that project&lt;/a&gt; and completed most of it recently. The main intention of the UTM URL Generator project was to learn the basics of few technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
