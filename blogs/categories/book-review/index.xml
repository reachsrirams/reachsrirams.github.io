      <description>My first publication &amp;#8220;OpenStack Networking Cookbook&amp;#8221; is now available for purchase. It is available as a printed book as well as e-book. OpenStack is a rapidly evolving cloud platform and Networking (Neutron) is one of its critical components. The current trends of SDN and NFV make OpenStack Networking even more exciting and complex. I have co-authored the book with a colleague and the overall experience of writing a book was very satisfying.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most management, leadership and self-help books tend to give generic advice and suggestions about how to manage your career at workplace. But in life we find that even similar situations require different actions. The main reason for this is that each situation involves different perspectives, people and possibilities. The book, &lt;strong&gt;101 Myths and Reality @ the Office&lt;/strong&gt; provides a situational view of our work environment. The book deals with practical situations such as appraisals, hike, promotions etc. And for each situation it gives relevant suggestions to employees as well as managers. &lt;strong&gt;This will be a great addition to your office bookshelf as an anytime reference&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
