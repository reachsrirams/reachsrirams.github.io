      <description>A very happy new year to the readers of my blogs. It is time for the semi-annual update about my blogging and learning goals. And I must say there are some interesting goals that I conjuring up for myself.
Status of 2017 second half goals I had set a goal to write 3 blogs in the second half of 2017 without specifically talking about what those blogs were. The reason was that I was experimenting with technologies like Docker and Cassandra.</description>

      <description>The customary update about my blogging and learning goals is here.
Status of 2017 first half goals  Enhance my OpenStack install scripts for _Newton_ and _Ocata _release. Newton release is already out and Ocata should release around May-mid  Score: 9&amp;frasl;10 Status: I completed the scripting for both Newton and Ocata release. The reason for 9 (instead of 10) is that there are 1-2 really minor issues that I need to fix.</description>

      <description>First of all a very happy new year to all the readers. The fact that this blog comes more than a month into 2017 should give you hints on what sort of goals I have planned for 2017 first half. I will start with an assessment of the second half of 2016.
Status of 2016 second half goals  Build and blog about a small OpenStack GUI related idea – this could be 1-2 blogs  Score: 8&amp;frasl;10 Status: I wrote two blogs related to OpenStack Horizon and shared my code on Github.</description>

      <description>As I have been doing for last few years, it is time to assess how well I have done on my blogging and learning goals. I will also share my goals for the second half of 2015.
Status for 2015 first half goals Here is my assessment of the goals I had set out for myself:
 Write 2 blogs related to OpenStack: this time I must blog about Open vSwitch and Neutron agents  Score: 9&amp;frasl;10 Status: While I wrote multiple blogs about OpenStack, I could not focus on Open vSwitch.</description>

      <description>Here I am once again, with fresh blogging and learning goals for the first half of 2015. This time I am able to share my goals earlier than usual. In the past, I was delayed by almost 2 months. This is clearly a good start for me and I hope that the rest of the year, I am able to stick to a better cadence for my blogging.
Status for 2014 second half goals Here is my assessment of the goals I had set out for myself last year.</description>

      <description>Here is my mid-year (I know I am off by couple of months) review of my blogging and learning goals for 2014. I will start off with my assessment of the first half of 2014 and then wrap with goals for the remaining four months of this year.
Status of 2014 first half goals  Complete the Understanding Virtual Networks series &amp;#8211; Finish the introductory blogs about OpenStack Networking and Open vSwitch  Status Update &amp;#8211; The OpenStack networking blog was completed as per plan but I could not cover Open vSwitch in detail.</description>

      <description>Like previous years, I want to continue the habit of sharing my goals around blogging and learning experiments. Clearly, this update for the first half of 2014 is already late. In addition, I did slip up on the important goals of 2013.
Status of 2013 Goals Here is my assessment of the goals I had set myself in the second half of 2014.
 Complete the blog series on Understanding Virtual Networks  Status Update: I completed the blogs related to Linux based Virtual Networking.</description>

      <description>At the beginning of the year, I had set myself few goals related to my blogging and learning activities. This belated mid-year review of those goals already gives an indication of how I have performed against the goals I set for myself:
Status and Score for 2013 1st half goals  Optimize my WordPress install for mobile viewing and better SEO  Status Update  Mobile version completed. I use Tiga wordpress theme which is Mobile friendly.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before I share my goals for the first half of 2013, here is an assessment of my 2012 goals. Around mid 2012, I had set out with some goals to learn a JavaScript, CSS and HTML5 as part of UTM URL Generator project. You can check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.innervoice.in/blogs/2012/06/29/how-i-am-learning-javascript-and-css/&#34;&gt;those goals here&lt;/a&gt;. Around November I reworked some of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.innervoice.in/blogs/2012/11/16/changes-to-my-url-generator-project-milestones/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;milestones of that project&lt;/a&gt; and completed most of it recently. The main intention of the UTM URL Generator project was to learn the basics of few technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
