      <description>Hiring is one of the most important activity for any manager. And the first task in the hiring process, is to write a job description. A &amp;rdquo;Job Description&amp;rdquo; is a narrative that describes the different aspects of the job such as responsibility, functions, skills etc. But in practice a typical Job Description (or JD) contains disproportionately more text on the skills requiredÂ rather than the nature of work itself.
A well written Job Description will give potential candidates a very good idea of what they can expect in the new opprtunity.</description>
