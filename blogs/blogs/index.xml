      <description>A very happy new year to the readers of my blogs. It is time for the semi-annual update about my blogging and learning goals. And I must say there are some interesting goals that I conjuring up for myself.
Status of 2017 second half goals I had set a goal to write 3 blogs in the second half of 2017 without specifically talking about what those blogs were. The reason was that I was experimenting with technologies like Docker and Cassandra.</description>

      <description>If you are a follower of this blog, you might have read about Using Docker with nginx and NodeJS. In this blog, I will discuss the code to build the two containers using Docker Compose. Finally, I will highlight an important capability of Docker that I learnt in this exercise. The source code being referred in this blog is available on GitHub.
Acknowledgement: I was inspired by this blog and wanted to take it further using Docker Compose.</description>

      <description>The best way to learn a new technology is by doing some hands-on practice or exercise. In order to learn the basics of Docker, I was scouting for a problem and the one that captured my imagination was how to use Docker for handling static web pages and dynamic REST APIs. In this 2-part blog, I will describe the problem and the solution first and then show how I implemented the solution using Docker.</description>

      <description>First of all a very happy new year to all the readers. The fact that this blog comes more than a month into 2017 should give you hints on what sort of goals I have planned for 2017 first half. I will start with an assessment of the second half of 2016.
Status of 2016 second half goals  Build and blog about a small OpenStack GUI related idea – this could be 1-2 blogs  Score: 8&amp;frasl;10 Status: I wrote two blogs related to OpenStack Horizon and shared my code on Github.</description>

      <description>As I have been doing for last few years, it is time to assess how well I have done on my blogging and learning goals. I will also share my goals for the second half of 2015.
Status for 2015 first half goals Here is my assessment of the goals I had set out for myself:
 Write 2 blogs related to OpenStack: this time I must blog about Open vSwitch and Neutron agents  Score: 9&amp;frasl;10 Status: While I wrote multiple blogs about OpenStack, I could not focus on Open vSwitch.</description>

      <description>In an earlier blog, I have talked about Linux bridge based virtual networking. Recently as part of a comment on my blog, I learnt how to view and interpret the MAC table of Linux bridge. In this installment of WILT (What I Learnt Today) series, I will share how MAC Table can be used for troubleshooting Linux bridges.

      <description>Here I am once again, with fresh blogging and learning goals for the first half of 2015. This time I am able to share my goals earlier than usual. In the past, I was delayed by almost 2 months. This is clearly a good start for me and I hope that the rest of the year, I am able to stick to a better cadence for my blogging.

      <description>Neutron is the networking project within the OpenStack cloud platform. The purpose of OpenStack Neutron is to provide physical and virtual network resources to the instances (or virtual machines). Before you continue to read this article I would recommend that you read about OpenStack networking concepts. To appreciate the architecture and the functionality of Neutron, it is important to understand the components that are part of Neutron.

      <description>In the next installment of &amp;#8220;What I learnt today&amp;#8221; or WILT, I briefly touch upon Network Namespace. I came across Namespace as part of my ongoing study of OpenStack networking. Namespaces are powerful constructs in Linux that allows you to create a copy of the TCP/IP network stack &amp;#8211; all the way from the Ethernet interfaces (L2), routing tables etc.
This concept of supporting multiple instances of routing tables, networking devices is not very new.</description>

      <description>Here is my mid-year (I know I am off by couple of months) review of my blogging and learning goals for 2014. I will start off with my assessment of the first half of 2014 and then wrap with goals for the remaining four months of this year.
Status of 2014 first half goals  Complete the Understanding Virtual Networks series &amp;#8211; Finish the introductory blogs about OpenStack Networking and Open vSwitch  Status Update &amp;#8211; The OpenStack networking blog was completed as per plan but I could not cover Open vSwitch in detail.</description>

      <description>If you were to ask someone &amp;#8220;what is the most popular open source hypervisor&amp;#8221; chances are that the answer will be KVM. Indeed KVM (or Kernel-based Virtual Machine) has played a key role in the open source Linux based virtualization environment. However is it really a hypervisor? Moreover, can KVM by itself run virtual machines? We will delve more into such questions in this blog. We will also understand the relationship between KVM and QEMU (Quick EMUlator).</description>

      <description>Like previous years, I want to continue the habit of sharing my goals around blogging and learning experiments. Clearly, this update for the first half of 2014 is already late. In addition, I did slip up on the important goals of 2013.
Status of 2013 Goals Here is my assessment of the goals I had set myself in the second half of 2014.
 Complete the blog series on Understanding Virtual Networks  Status Update: I completed the blogs related to Linux based Virtual Networking.</description>

      <description>In the previous blog of this series we saw that using Linux bridge we can connect a virtual Ethernet port of a VM to the physical Ethernet port of the hypervisor server. Let us now focus a bit more on these virtual ports to see what happens behind the scenes to make virtual networking actually work.
Physical vs. Virtual Networking The network data traffic is handled by the physical Ethernet ports on physical machines.</description>

      <description>Software defined networking (SDN) is the current wave sweeping the networking industry. And one of the key enablers of SDN is virtual networking. While SDN and virtual networking are in vogue these days, the support for virtual networking is not a recent development. And Linux bridge has been the pioneer in this regard.
Linux Bridge &amp;#8211; The Basics Virtual networking requires the presence of a virtual switch inside a server/hypervisor.</description>

      <description>At the beginning of the year, I had set myself few goals related to my blogging and learning activities. This belated mid-year review of those goals already gives an indication of how I have performed against the goals I set for myself:
Status and Score for 2013 1st half goals  Optimize my WordPress install for mobile viewing and better SEO  Status Update  Mobile version completed. I use Tiga wordpress theme which is Mobile friendly.</description>

      <title>Goals for 2013</title>

      <guid>http://reachsrirams.github.io/blogs/2013/01/01/goals-for-2013/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before I share my goals for the first half of 2013, here is an assessment of my 2012 goals. Around mid 2012, I had set out with some goals to learn a JavaScript, CSS and HTML5 as part of UTM URL Generator project. You can check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.innervoice.in/blogs/2012/06/29/how-i-am-learning-javascript-and-css/&#34;&gt;those goals here&lt;/a&gt;. Around November I reworked some of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.innervoice.in/blogs/2012/11/16/changes-to-my-url-generator-project-milestones/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;milestones of that project&lt;/a&gt; and completed most of it recently. The main intention of the UTM URL Generator project was to learn the basics of few technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HTML5 Local Storage – 5 Useful Tips</title>
      <link>http://reachsrirams.github.io/blogs/2012/12/27/html5-local-storage-tips-and-tricks/</link>

      <guid>http://reachsrirams.github.io/blogs/2012/12/27/html5-local-storage-tips-and-tricks/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;HTML5 Local Storage is a browser based &lt;em&gt;key-value database&lt;/em&gt; that is available for client side applications. Java programmers (like me) will find that  HTML5 Local Storage is very similar to HashMap (or Hashtable). It is important to remember that Local Storage is available to client side applications even across browser restarts. In that context, Local Storage is similar to cookies. &lt;strong&gt;But unlike cookies, Local Storage is not accessible to the server side applications. &lt;/strong&gt;Also cookies provide very limited storage (4 KB).&lt;/p&gt;
