      <description>As I have been doing for last few years, it is time to assess how well I have done on my blogging and learning goals. I will also share my goals for the second half of 2015.
Status for 2015 first half goals Here is my assessment of the goals I had set out for myself:
 Write 2 blogs related to OpenStack: this time I must blog about Open vSwitch and Neutron agents  Score: 9&amp;frasl;10 Status: While I wrote multiple blogs about OpenStack, I could not focus on Open vSwitch.</description>

      <description>Here is my mid-year (I know I am off by couple of months) review of my blogging and learning goals for 2014. I will start off with my assessment of the first half of 2014 and then wrap with goals for the remaining four months of this year.
Status of 2014 first half goals  Complete the Understanding Virtual Networks series &amp;#8211; Finish the introductory blogs about OpenStack Networking and Open vSwitch  Status Update &amp;#8211; The OpenStack networking blog was completed as per plan but I could not cover Open vSwitch in detail.</description>

      <description>Like previous years, I want to continue the habit of sharing my goals around blogging and learning experiments. Clearly, this update for the first half of 2014 is already late. In addition, I did slip up on the important goals of 2013.
Status of 2013 Goals Here is my assessment of the goals I had set myself in the second half of 2014.
 Complete the blog series on Understanding Virtual Networks  Status Update: I completed the blogs related to Linux based Virtual Networking.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before I share my goals for the first half of 2013, here is an assessment of my 2012 goals. Around mid 2012, I had set out with some goals to learn a JavaScript, CSS and HTML5 as part of UTM URL Generator project. You can check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.innervoice.in/blogs/2012/06/29/how-i-am-learning-javascript-and-css/&#34;&gt;those goals here&lt;/a&gt;. Around November I reworked some of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.innervoice.in/blogs/2012/11/16/changes-to-my-url-generator-project-milestones/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;milestones of that project&lt;/a&gt; and completed most of it recently. The main intention of the UTM URL Generator project was to learn the basics of few technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
