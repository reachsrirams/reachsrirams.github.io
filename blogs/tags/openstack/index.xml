      <description>I am late by a month in sharing my blogging and learning goals for the first half of 2016. Let&amp;#8217;s start with a review of the second half of 2015.
Status of 2015 second half goals  YouTube video related to OpenStack – making a video is not easy but I believe I have nailed down the topic for the video.  Score: 10&amp;frasl;10 Status: I published a YouTube video on OpenStack Neutron Ports.</description>

      <description>As I have been doing for last few years, it is time to assess how well I have done on my blogging and learning goals. I will also share my goals for the second half of 2015.
Status for 2015 first half goals Here is my assessment of the goals I had set out for myself:
 Write 2 blogs related to OpenStack: this time I must blog about Open vSwitch and Neutron agents  Score: 9&amp;frasl;10 Status: While I wrote multiple blogs about OpenStack, I could not focus on Open vSwitch.</description>

      <title>Using MAC table – Linux Bridge – WILT</title>
      <link>http://reachsrirams.github.io/blogs/2015/01/26/using-mac-table-linux-bridge-wilt/</link>

      <description>In an earlier blog, I have talked about Linux bridge based virtual networking. Recently as part of a comment on my blog, I learnt how to view and interpret the MAC table of Linux bridge. In this installment of WILT (What I Learnt Today) series, I will share how MAC Table can be used for troubleshooting Linux bridges.
MAC Table &amp;#8211; Background Bridges and Switches forward packets by examining and learning MAC address from incoming packets.</description>

      <title>Linux Network Namespace – WILT</title>
      <link>http://reachsrirams.github.io/blogs/2014/12/17/linux-network-namespace-wilt/</link>

      <description>In the next installment of &amp;#8220;What I learnt today&amp;#8221; or WILT, I briefly touch upon Network Namespace. I came across Namespace as part of my ongoing study of OpenStack networking. Namespaces are powerful constructs in Linux that allows you to create a copy of the TCP/IP network stack &amp;#8211; all the way from the Ethernet interfaces (L2), routing tables etc.
This concept of supporting multiple instances of routing tables, networking devices is not very new.</description>

      <description>Here is my mid-year (I know I am off by couple of months) review of my blogging and learning goals for 2014. I will start off with my assessment of the first half of 2014 and then wrap with goals for the remaining four months of this year.
Status of 2014 first half goals  Complete the Understanding Virtual Networks series &amp;#8211; Finish the introductory blogs about OpenStack Networking and Open vSwitch  Status Update &amp;#8211; The OpenStack networking blog was completed as per plan but I could not cover Open vSwitch in detail.</description>

      <title>Goals for 2013</title>
      <link>http://reachsrirams.github.io/blogs/2013/01/01/goals-for-2013/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before I share my goals for the first half of 2013, here is an assessment of my 2012 goals. Around mid 2012, I had set out with some goals to learn a JavaScript, CSS and HTML5 as part of UTM URL Generator project. You can check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.innervoice.in/blogs/2012/06/29/how-i-am-learning-javascript-and-css/&#34;&gt;those goals here&lt;/a&gt;. Around November I reworked some of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.innervoice.in/blogs/2012/11/16/changes-to-my-url-generator-project-milestones/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;milestones of that project&lt;/a&gt; and completed most of it recently. The main intention of the UTM URL Generator project was to learn the basics of few technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Understanding Virtual Networks – Ports and VLAN</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.innervoice.in/blogs/2012/08/16/understanding-virtual-networks-the-basics/?utm_campaign=promote_blog&amp;utm_medium=allpurpose&amp;utm_source=innervoice.in&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; we looked at the fundamental building blocks of physical and virtual networks. Now let us look at two key concepts in physical and virtual networks. They are Ports and VLAN.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In order understand Virtual Networking let us start with the simplest network that many of us operate every day – our home network. The picture below captures what a typical home network looks like. I am sure most of us use wireless rather than wired networks at home but the underlying concepts are very much alike.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Upcoming technologies like OpenFlow and SDN are altering the networking landscape very quickly. The underlying drivers are Cloud Computing and Virtualization. Servers, Storage and Networking make up the trinity for effective Cloud computing strategy. Servers and Storage Virtualization has helped drive the adoption of flexible cloud services already. Now it is time for Network Virtualization.&lt;/p&gt;
