      <description>&lt;p&gt;OpenStack is made up of various services. These services have their own logs stored under /var/log directory. While working on OpenStack related projects it is quite common to monitor the logs for any problems or errors. While the tail command is the most popular, there are many benefits of using web browser to view the logs. In this blog let us see how we can view OpenStack Controller Logs using a browser.

      <guid>http://reachsrirams.github.io/blogs/2016/01/02/pycharm-and-openstack-programming/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;OpenStack is based on the Python programming language and DevStack is the most common development and test environment for OpenStack. If you are doing serious, professional programming around OpenStack, it is very useful to have a proper development environment. In this blog, I will show you how to use the &lt;strong&gt;PyCharm IDE&lt;/strong&gt; from Jetbrains for your OpenStack programming. I will use the &lt;strong&gt;Neutron ML2 driver code from my book &lt;a href=&#34;http://goo.gl/TeXSYQ&#34;&gt;OpenStack Networking Cookbook&lt;/a&gt; to guide you&lt;/strong&gt; in setting up the PyCharm IDE.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Announcing: OpenStack Networking Cookbook</title>
      <link>http://reachsrirams.github.io/blogs/2015/10/23/openstack-networking-cookbook/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 23 Oct 2015 16:47:23 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://reachsrirams.github.io/blogs/2015/10/23/openstack-networking-cookbook/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My first publication &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://bit.ly/1NrKjty&#34;&gt;OpenStack Networking Cookbook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is now available for purchase. It is available as a printed book as well as e-book. OpenStack is a rapidly evolving cloud platform and Networking (Neutron) is one of its critical components. The current trends of SDN and NFV make OpenStack Networking even more exciting and complex. I have co-authored the book with a colleague and the overall experience of writing a book was very satisfying.

      <title>Ports in OpenStack Neutron</title>
      <link>http://reachsrirams.github.io/blogs/2015/07/04/ports-in-openstack-neutron/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 04 Jul 2015 18:55:10 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://reachsrirams.github.io/blogs/2015/07/04/ports-in-openstack-neutron/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;OpenStack supports rich abstractions to handle &lt;a href=&#34;http://reachsrirams.github.io/blogs/blogs/2014/04/06/openstack-networking/&#34;&gt;virtual networking needs in a cloud&lt;/a&gt;. As a user the most visible entities are the Network, Subnets, Routers, Firewall etc. But if we consider ingress and egress points for data traffic, the most critical entity is the Port. OpenStack Neutron Ports are usually created automatically as part of other user operations. However the CLI allows users to create Ports independently as well.

      <title>VirtualBox networking settings for OpenStack</title>
      <link>http://reachsrirams.github.io/blogs/2015/06/14/virtualbox-networking-settings-for-openstack/</link>

      <guid>http://reachsrirams.github.io/blogs/2015/06/14/virtualbox-networking-settings-for-openstack/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The best way to learn OpenStack is by installing, running and playing with it directly. In this blog, I will share the details of the VirtualBox based multi-node OpenStack installation. I will be focusing &lt;strong&gt;only on the networking aspects when using VirtualBox&lt;/strong&gt;. I will also share some tips that are important in this deployment. This blog will not cover the steps to install and create a virtual machine using VirtualBox.

While most people use DevStack to accomplish this I prefer to setup a multi-node installation. This is important for me because much of my work related to OpenStack revolves around Networking. Another reason is that a multi-node installation is what real users of OpenStack will also be deploying.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I briefly talked about OpenStack Neutron plugins and agents in &lt;a href=&#34;http://reachsrirams.github.io/blogs/blogs/2015/01/13/openstack-neutron-components/&#34;&gt;my blog about OpenStack Neutron components&lt;/a&gt;. In this blog, let us go a step further and understand the roles of plugins and the agents.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href=&#34;http://reachsrirams.github.io/blogs/blogs/2013/12/02/linux-bridge-virtual-networking/&#34;&gt;earlier blog&lt;/a&gt;, I have talked about Linux bridge based virtual networking. Recently as part of a comment on my blog, I learnt how to view and interpret the MAC table of Linux bridge. In this installment of WILT (What I Learnt Today) series, I will share how MAC Table can be used for troubleshooting Linux bridges.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the next installment of &amp;ldquo;What I learnt today&amp;rdquo; or WILT, I briefly touch upon Network Namespace. I came across Namespace as part of my ongoing study of OpenStack networking. Namespaces are powerful constructs in Linux that allows you to create a &lt;strong&gt;copy of the TCP/IP network stack -all the way from the Ethernet interfaces (L2), routing tables etc.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Setting up OpenStack at home</title>

      <guid>http://reachsrirams.github.io/blogs/2014/11/13/setting-openstack-home/</guid>
      <description>The goal of this blog is to share some details about how I have setup a cost-effective OpenStack Lab at home. For most enthusiasts, DevStack is the preferred way to experiment with OpenStack. But I wanted something more realistic for my experiments.
OpenStack is intended for multi-tenant, distributed and highly scalable cloud. To appreciate its architecture I needed to move beyond DevStack. With a more realistic setup, you can understand how the distributed OpenStack components interact with each other.</description>

      <title>Wired and Wireless network on Ubuntu for OpenStack</title>
      <link>http://reachsrirams.github.io/blogs/2014/06/29/wired-wireless-network-ubuntu-openstack/</link>

      <guid>http://reachsrirams.github.io/blogs/2014/06/29/wired-wireless-network-ubuntu-openstack/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In data center and cloud environment, servers used for hosting the virtual machines usually have more than one wired networking interfaces. In fact there are multiple Ethernet interfaces on each server. It is common practice to use one of the interface for &amp;lsquo;managing&amp;rsquo; the host itself. This interface is usually accessible from corporate networks and administrators will use this interface for doing SSH into the server. The other interfaces are usually used for virtual machine traffic or storage traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://reachsrirams.github.io/blogs/2014/04/06/openstack-networking/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I continue the series on virtual networking with an overview of OpenStack networking concepts. OpenStack is an open source project with an aim to create a scalable cloud operating platform. The primary goal of this software platform is to help build public and private clouds. Specifically it allows users to build and operate infrastructure as a service or &lt;strong&gt;IaaS&lt;/strong&gt; clouds.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://reachsrirams.github.io/blogs/2013/01/01/goals-for-2013/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before I share my goals for the first half of 2013, here is an assessment of my 2012 goals. Around mid 2012, I had set out with some goals to learn a JavaScript, CSS and HTML5 as part of UTM URL Generator project. You can check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.innervoice.in/blogs/2012/06/29/how-i-am-learning-javascript-and-css/&#34;&gt;those goals here&lt;/a&gt;. Around November I reworked some of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.innervoice.in/blogs/2012/11/16/changes-to-my-url-generator-project-milestones/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;milestones of that project&lt;/a&gt; and completed most of it recently. The main intention of the UTM URL Generator project was to learn the basics of few technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
